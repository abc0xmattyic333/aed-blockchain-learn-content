# How To Begin Your Journey As A Blockchain Developer! :)

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures the data is secure, transparent, and cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and gaining consensus from the network.

Think of it like a digital chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked together in a chronological order, creating a chain. The key features of blockchain include:

Decentralization: No single entity controls the entire network. Instead, all participants (nodes) share control.

Transparency: All transactions are visible to anyone in the network, providing transparency and traceability.

Security: The use of cryptographic hashing ensures that data within the blockchain is secure and tamper-proof.

Immutability: Once data is recorded in a block, it is very difficult to change, making the data immutable.
